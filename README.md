About<br />
<img src="images/my-bubbe-says-about-page.png" alt="a bio page for the developer, coder, and creator reads: Hi, I'm Taylor,
and my bubbe says I'm a mensch. I am a former educator with a Master's Degree in Applied Linguistics from Columbia University. I am deeply curious about language acquisitionâ€”whether it be JavaScript, Python, or Yiddish. In addition to being a software engineer, I am also the great-granddaughter of Gussie Ratner: the only surviving member of her family after the Holocaust. I am incredibly passionate about the preservation of all the distinct words and phrases my family uses to communicate their connection to the past, and hopefully the future. My Bubbe Says was coded with the goal of helping us all remember the difference between a shlimazel and a schmegegge, a schtick and a schmuck, to kvell and to kvetch. Life is better with your meshuggeneh mishpucha. There are options to visit Taylor's LinkedIn, dev.to blog, github profile, and the readme document for this site." height="400"/>
